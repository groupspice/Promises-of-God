        <text><![CDATA[READ ME FIRSTMost people want to live a healthy, balanced spiritual life, but few achieve this by themselves. And most small groups struggle to balance all of God’s purposes in their meetings. Groups tend to overemphasize one of the  ve purposes, perhaps fellowship or discipleship. Rarely is there a healthy balance that includes evangelism, ministry, and worship. That’s why we’ve included all of these elements in this study so you can live a healthy, balanced spiritual life over time.A typical group session will include the following:Memory VersesFor each session we have provided a memory verse that emphasizes an important truth from the session. This is an optional exercise, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of  ll- ing our minds with God’s Word. We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING with God’s Family (Fellowship)The foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection with God and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn your trust provide a place to experience the life Jesus invites you to live. This section of each session typically o ers you two activities.6]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstYou can get to know your whole group by using the icebreaker ques- tion, and/or you can check in with one or two group members—your spiritual partner(s)—for a deeper connection and encouragement in your spiritual journey.DVD TEACHING SEGMENT. A Deepening Life Together: Prom- ises of God Video Teaching DVD companion to this study guide is available. For each study session, the DVD contains a lesson taught by Dennis Keating. If you are using the DVD, you will view the teaching segment after your Connecting discussion and before your group dis- cussion time (the Growing section). At the end of each session in this study guide you will  nd space for your notes on the teaching segment.GROWING to Be Like Christ (Discipleship)Here is where you come face-to-face with Scripture. In core passages you’ll explore what the Bible teaches about the topic of the study. The focus won’t be on accumulating information but on how we should live in light of the Word of God. We want to help you apply the Scriptures practically, creatively, and from your heart as well as your head. At the end of the day, allowing the timeless truths from God’s Word to transform our lives in Christ is our greatest aim.DEVELOPING Your Gifts to Serve Others (Ministry)Jesus trained his disciples to discover and develop their gifts to serve others. And God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in a way no other person can. This section will help you discover and use your God-given design. It will also encourage your group to discover your unique design as a community. In this study, you’ll put into practice what you’ve learned in the Bible study by taking a step to serve others. These simple steps will take your group on a faith journey that could change your lives forever.7]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstSHARING Your Life Mission Every Day (Evangelism)Many people skip over this aspect of the Christian life because it’s scary, relationally awkward, or simply too much work for their busy schedules. But Jesus wanted all of his disciples to help outsiders con- nect with him, to know him personally. This doesn’t mean preaching on street corners. It could mean welcoming a few newcomers into your group, hosting a short-term group in your home, or walking through this study with a friend. In this study, you’ll have an op- portunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SURRENDERING Your Life for God’s Pleasure (Worship)God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in prayer and worship. You may read a psalm together, share a page in your jour- nal, or sing a song to close your meeting. If you have never prayed aloud in a group before, no one will pressure you. Instead, you’ll experience the support of others who are praying for you.Study NotesThis section provides background notes on the Bible passage(s) you examine in the Growing section. You may want to refer to these notes during your group meeting or as a reference for those doing additional study.For Deeper Study (Optional)If you want to dig deeper into more Bible passages about the topic at hand, we’ve provided additional passages and questions. Your group may choose to do study homework ahead of each meeting in order to cover more biblical material. Or you as an individual may choose to study the For Deeper Study on your own. If you prefer not to do study homework, the Growing section will provide8]]></text>

These options allow individuals or the whole group to go deeper in their study, while still accommodating those who can’t do homework or are new to your group.You can record your discoveries in your journal. We encourage you to read some of your insights to a friend (spiritual partner) for accountability and support. Spiritual partners may check in each week over the phone, through e-mail, or at the beginning of the group meeting.Re ectionsOn the Re ections pages we provide Scriptures to read and re ect on between group meetings. We suggest you use this section to seek God at home throughout the week. This time at home should begin and end with prayer. Don’t get in a hurry; take enough time to hear God’s direction.Subgroup for Discussion and PrayerIf your group is large (more than seven people), we encourage you to separate into groups of two to four for discussion and prayer. This is to encourage greater participation and deeper discussion.9]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[INTRODUCTIONWelcome to the Deepening Life Together Bible study on the Prom- ises of God. As we live this Bible study experience together, we will unpack principles from God’s Word that reveal the faithfulness of God to keep his promises. The journey you are about to embark on will take you step-by-step through God’s unfolding promise to restore humanity to perfect relationship with him through Abraham, David, and eventually through his son, Jesus Christ. As you read, discuss, and re ect on the topic of each session, your con dence in God’s faithfulness will grow to new heights.This journey will connect you with our loving and faithful God and with other believers. For some of you, this might be the  rst time you’ve connected in a small group community. We want you to know that God cares about you and your spiritual growth. As you prayerfully respond to the principles you learn in this study, God will move you to a deeper level of commitment and intimacy with himself, as well as with those in your small group.We at Baker Books and Lifetogether Publishing look forward to hearing the stories of how God changes you from the inside out during this small group experience. We pray God blesses you with all he has planned for you through this journey together.11]]></text>

While we may be able to imagine God’s creation before the Fall, without absolute knowledge of his original design, our imperfect imaginations fall short of God’s perfection.We will get to see God’s creation in all its intended glory one day. But until then, we must wait in our present, imperfect condition. Thankfully, because God is faithful to keep his promises, we don’t have to wait alone.Today, we will learn about not only the consequences of Adam and Eve’s sin on creation, but also God’s subsequent promise to restore humanity to its unfallen state in perfect relationship with him. In the weeks to come, as we see God’s plan for the ful llment of his promise revealed, we will be assured that he keeps his promises today.ConnectingBegin your group time with prayer. Ask God to open your hearts to receive his Word through this Bible study and for the courage to change as he challenges you in the weeks to come.Deeper relationships happen when we take the time to keep in touch with one another. As you begin, pass around a copy of the Small Group Roster, a sheet of paper, or one of you pass your study guide, opened to the Small Group Roster. When the roster gets to you write down your contact information, including the best time13]]></text>

Begin this  rst session by introducing yourselves. Include your name, what you do for a living, and what you do for fun. You may also include whether or not you are married, how long you have been married, how many children you have, and their ages. Also share what brought you to this small group study of the Promises of God and what you expect to learn during the next seven sessions.2. Whether your group is new or ongoing, it’s always important to re ect on and review your values together. In the Appen- dix is a Small Group Agreement with the values most useful in sustaining healthy, balanced groups. Choose two or three values that you have room to grow in, or haven’t previously focused on, to emphasize during this study. Doing this will take your group to the next stage of intimacy and spiritual health.If your group is new, you may want to focus on welcoming newcomers or on sharing group ownership. Any group will quickly move from being “the leader’s group” to “our group” if everyone understands the goals of the group and shares a small role. See the Team Roles in the Appendix for help on how to do this well.3. Think about what a perfect world might be like, and respond brie y to one of the following questions (each group member may choose one):t What would a perfect world look like? t How would people behave?t Where would you live?t What would you do with your time?14]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[The Promise InitiatedGrowingTo complete his perfect creation, God places Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden to live in a harmonious relationship with one another and with him. When Adam and Eve rebel against God, his perfect justice demands that he punish them for their sin. Yet in the midst of judgment, God promises that one day he will crush the power of Satan and restore the relationship.Read Genesis 2:4–25.4. In 2:15–17, how does God restrict Adam when he places him in the garden?5. What do you learn about God from 2:7–10, 15–18?Read Genesis 3:1–24.6. What do you learn about the serpent (Satan) in 3:1–5?7. See the Study Notes for insight into the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. How does Satan go about tempting Eve to eat from the forbidden tree (3:1, 4–5)?Why do you think Satan chooses this particular approach?8. After Adam and Eve eat the fruit, they immediately realize the gravity of their sin and hide in shame (3:7–10). How is Adam and Eve’s reaction to the revelation of their sin similar to our own reactions to wrongdoing today?9. God seeks out Adam and Eve, asking, “Where are you?” Does God do this when you sin? What does this say about God’s character?10. What is the signi cance of Adam and Eve’s realization of their nakedness (3:7; compare 2:25)?15]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Promises of God11. God clearly cares about Adam and Eve in Genesis 3:14–24, so why do you think he follows through by judging them and not only Satan?12. Look at the judgments God declares upon Adam, Eve, Satan, and all creation in the table below. How do you see each one manifesting itself in society today?Adam EveHard work to survive (v. 19)Eventual physical death (v. 19)God’s JudgmentsSatanCreationThe ground is cursed to be less fertile (vv. 17–18)Pain in childbirth (v. 16a)Cursed (v. 14)Desire . . . rule by husband(v. 16b)Enmity between him and Eve’s descendant(v. 15)13. When Adam and Eve rebel against God, his perfect justice demands that he impose the promised consequences for their sin. Yet in the midst of that judgment, God makes another promise. See the Study Notes for the meaning of the “seed” in 3:15 and the Fall.What promise does God make in 3:15? What do you think this means?14. Why is it important for God to banish Adam and Eve from the garden (3:22–23)?15. What does this story of command, sin, judgment, and promise have to do with you?Although Adam and Eve were created to live in a perfect relation- ship with God, they chose to disobey him and reject his authority in their lives. To meet the demands of his own perfect justice, God judged them for that sin, and Adam and Eve, and all of creation, entered into a fallen state. While pronouncing judgment against the serpent who tempted them, God promised that one day a descendant (“seed”) of the woman would break the power of Satan, sin, and16]]></text>

The  rst step in developing the gifts that God has given each of us, is to deepen our relationship with him through prayer, re ection, and meditation on his Word. Through these disciplines, we learn how to hear his voice and submit to the leading of the Holy Spirit.16. Developing our ability to serve God according to the leading of the Holy Spirit requires that we make time to let God speak to us daily. Which of the following next steps toward this goal are you willing to take for the next few weeks?t Prayer. Commit to connecting with God daily through per- sonal prayer. It’s important to separate yourself from the distractions in your life so you can really focus on commu- nicating with God. Some people  nd it helpful to write out their prayers in a journal.t Re ection. At the end of each session you’ll  nd Re ections Scriptures that speci cally relate to the topic of our study for the session. These are provided to give you an opportunity for reading a short Bible passage  ve days a week during the course of this study. Write down your insights on what you read each day in the space provided. On the sixth day, summarize what God has shown you throughout the week.t Meditation. Psalm 119:11 says: “I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you” (NIV). Medita- tion is focused attention on the Word of God and is a great way to internalize God’s Word more deeply. One way to do this is to write a portion of Scripture on a card and tape it somewhere where you’re sure to see it often, such as your bathroom mirror, car’s dashboard, or the kitchen table. Think about it as you get dressed in the morning, when17]]></text>

Consider using the passages provided in the Re ections pages in each session. As you meditate upon these Scriptures, you will notice them beginning to take up residence in your heart and mind.SharingJesus lived and died so that mankind might come to know him and be reconciled to God through him. His  nal words before his ascension recorded in Acts 1:8 were: “You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth” (NIV). Through the Holy Spirit, we are empowered to be his witnesses to those around us.17. Jesus wants all of his disciples to help others connect with him, to know him personally. In the weeks to come, you’ll be asked to identify and share with people in your circle of in uence who need to know Jesus or need to connect with him through a small group community. With this in mind, as you go about your day-to-day activities this week, pay special attention to the people God has placed in your life. There may be co-workers, family or friends, other parents at school or sporting events that you see or talk to on a regular basis. When we meet next time, we’ll talk about how to help connect believers to Chris- tian community and begin sharing Jesus with those who don’t yet know him.SurrenderingGod wants us to turn our hearts to him. Second Chronicles 16:9 says: “The eyes of the Lord search the whole earth in order to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him” (NLT). Each week you will have a chance to surrender your hearts to God in worship18]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[The Promise Initiatedand prayer.18. Every believer should have a plan for spending time alone with God. Your time with God is personal and re ects who you are in relationship with our personal God. However you choose to spend your time with him, try to allow time for praise, prayer, and reading of Scripture. Re ections are provided at the end of each session for you to use as part of your daily time with God. These will o er reinforcement of the principles you are learning, and develop or strengthen your habit of time alone with God throughout the week.19. Before you close your group in prayer, answer this question: “How can we pray for you this week?” Write prayer requests on your Prayer and Praise Report and commit to praying for each other throughout the week.Study NotesTree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil: This tree signi es the giv- ing of knowledge of good and evil. Stealing this knowledge leads to spiritual, and eventually physical, death. The knowledge referred to is moral knowledge (discernment). God created Adam and Eve with a degree of moral discernment, the ability to know obedience from disobedience. But they don’t understand evil either as a concept or from experience. In eating from the tree, they disobey God and so understand evil from personal experience.If Adam had not disobeyed God, God might eventually have let him come to understand evil by observing it in other creatures like Satan. In fact, Adam might have understood evil more deeply that way, without experiencing it. One doesn’t need to be a drug addict in order to understand addiction, and addicts can be in denial about things in themselves that are obvious to non-addicts who closely observe them. So God wasn’t trying to keep Adam from growing up. He was trying to help Adam grow up in good time, in the right way.19]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Promises of GodIt was not therefore a “power” imbued by the tree that gave Adam knowledge of evil, but the act of disobedience that gave it.The Fall: This term is used to describe the rebellious state of human- ity, which occurred when Adam and Eve willfully disobeyed God and ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The Bible makes it clear that every person is a sinner before he or she has opportunity to sin because the capacity to sin is inborn, inherited from Adam and Eve as a result of the Fall.Seed of the Woman: The o spring of the woman who would eventu- ally crush the serpent’s (Satan’s) head is Jesus Christ.The Curse: A term used to describe God’s judgments on creation after the Fall.For Deeper Study (Optional)Read Romans 5:12–21 and answer the questions below.1. What do verses 12–14 suggest about the e ect that Adam’s sin had on humanity?2. Contrast the gift of God through Jesus Christ with the judg- ment of God through Adam as stated in verses 16–19.3. Romans 5:17 tells us that death reigned as a result of sin. Notice that verse 21 says sin reigned in death. As death reigned over our lives, sin reigned as well. What does this suggest about the nature of man resulting from the Fall? What does verse 21 say is accomplished through Jesus Christ?4. Romans 5:15–21 provides a clear contrast between the con- demning act of Adam and the redeeming act of Jesus Christ. How does this passage bring clarity to your understanding of20]]></text>

A “get to know you” co ee, dinner, or dessert is a great way to launch a new study. You may want to review the Small Group Agreement and share the names of a few friends you can invite to join you. But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we  nd new members for our group?This can be challenging, especially for new groups that have only a fewpeopleorforexistinggroupsthatloseafewpeoplealongtheway. We encourage you to pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another good strategy is to ask church leaders to make an announcement that your group is open to new members.No matter how you  nd members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new lead- ers, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too small, it could be at risk of shutting down. If you and your group stay open, you’ll be amazed at the people God sends your way. The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s totally up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their  rst six months together, but every other week can work as well. We strongly recommend that80]]></text>

This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide whether heorshewantstocontinueonforanotherstudy.Somegroupslaunch relationships that last for years, and others are stepping-stones into another group experience. Either way, enjoy the journey.What if this group is not working for me?Personality con icts, life stage di erences, geographical distance, level of spiritual maturity, or any number of things can cause you to feel the group doesn’t work for you. Relax. Pray for God’s direc- tion, and at the end of this study decide whether to continue with this group or  nd another. You don’t buy the  rst car you look at or marry the  rst person you date, and the same goes with a group. Don’t bail out before the study is  nished—God might have some- thing to teach you. Also, don’t run from con ict or prejudge people before you have given them a chance. God is still working in you too!Who is the leader?Most groups have an o cial leader. But ideally, the group will ma- ture and members will share the facilitation of meetings. We have discovered that healthy groups share hosting and leading of the group. This model ensures that all members grow, give their unique contribution, and develop their gifts. This study guide and the Holy Spirit can keep things on track even when you share leadership. Christ has promised to be in your midst as you gather. Ultimately, God is your leader each step of the way.How do we handle the child care needs in our group?This can be a sensitive issue. We suggest that you empower the group to openly brainstorm solutions. You may try one option that works for a while and then adjust over time. Our favorite approach is for adults to meet in the living room or dining room, and share the cost of a babysitter (or two) who can be with the kids in a di erent part of the house. In this way, parents don’t have to be away from their children all evening when their children are too young to be left at81]]></text>

A third idea is to rotate the responsi- bility of providing a lesson or care for the children either in the same home or in another home nearby. This can be an incredible blessing for kids. Finally, the most common idea is to decide that you need to have a night to invest in your spiritual lives individually or as a couple, and make your own arrangements for child care. No mat- ter what decision the group makes, the best approach is to dialogue openly about both the problem and the solution.82]]></text>

Remember who is in control; the time to worry is when you’re not worried. Those who are soft in heart (and sweaty- palmed) are those whom God is sure to speak through.Seek support. Ask your leader, coleader, or close friend to pray for you and prepare with you before the session. Walking through the study will help you anticipate potentially di cult questions and discussion topics.Bring your uniqueness to the study. Lean into who you are and how God wants you to uniquely lead the study.Prepare. Prepare. Prepare. Go through the session several times. If you are using the DVD, listen to the teaching segment and Leader Lifter. Consider writing in a journal or fasting for a day to prepare yourself for what God wants to do.Don’t wait until the last minute to prepare.Ask for feedback so you can grow. Perhaps in an e-mail or on cards handed out at the study, have everyone write down three things you did well and one thing you could improve on. Don’t get defensive, but show an openness to learn and grow.Prayerfully consider launching a new group. This doesn’t need to happen overnight, but God’s heart is for this to happen over time. Not all Christians are called to be leaders or teachers, but we are all called to be “shepherds” of a few someday.Share with your group what God is doing in your heart. God is searching for those whose hearts are fully his. Share your trials and victories. We promise that people will relate.Prayerfully consider whom you would like to pass the baton to next week. It’s only fair. God is ready for the next member of your group to go on the faith journey you just traveled. Make it fun, and expect God to do the rest.116]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Session One The Promise InitiatedConnecting1. We’ve designed this study for both new and established groups, and for both seekers and the spiritually mature. New groups will need to invest more time building relationships with each other. Established groups often want to dig deeper into Bible study and application. Regardless of whether your group is new or has been together for a while, be sure to answer this introductory question at this  rst session.2. A very important item in this  rst session is the Small Group Agreement. An agreement helps clarify your group’s priorities and cast new vision for what the group can become. You can  nd this in the Appendix of this study guide. We’ve found that groups that talk about these values up front and commit to an agreement bene t signi cantly. They work through con icts long before people get to the point of frustration, so there’s a lot less pain.Take some time to review this agreement before your meeting. Then during your meeting, read the agreement aloud to the entire group. If some people have concerns about a speci c item or the agreement as a whole, be sensitive to their concerns. Explain that tens of thousands of groups use agreements like this one as a simple tool for building trust and group health over time.We recommend talking about shared ownership of the group. It’s im- portant that each member have a role. See pages the Appendix to learn more about Team Roles. This is a great tool to get this important practice launched in your group.GrowingHave someone read Bible passages aloud. It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.4. God tells Adam that he must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. It is the only restriction placed on humans in the garden.5. Allow the group to highlight what they notice from the text. Some things about God might be: God gives Adam responsibilities in the garden; God provides for Adam’s need for food and water; God gives Adam a choice120LEADER’S NOTESSESSIONS]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notesto obey or not; God expects obedience but also gives humans freedom of choice and the ability to think for ourselves; God gives commands and warns of the consequences of failing to obey, which show his love and concern; God cares about beauty, because his creation is beautiful; God cares about Adam’s need for companionship.6. Some things about Satan might include: Satan is deceptive; Satan misquotes and twists God’s words; Satan causes Eve to doubt God’s goodness; Satan takes a good motive of aspiring to be more like God and turns it toward disobedience.7. At the heart of Satan’s deception is questioning the reliability and goodness of God’s word. Humanity’s nature is to question God’s faithfulness, espe- cially when circumstances don’t seem to make sense. If Satan can convince us to doubt God, then he has been successful in alienating us from him, inviting evil into our lives. Satan also tempts Adam and Eve to be like God, to take charge of their destinies apart from God.8. We tend to run from situations and people, and even God, when we have done wrong. Even though we may know we have sinned, we fail to face it straight on. It’s humiliating and frightening to face the truth about ourselves.9. Even though we sin, God does not abandon us. He consistently loves us and provides for us, even when we don’t live up to His standard for us.10. This moment is the birth of shame, which is an emotion of feeling exposed as  awed or inadequate. They know the di erence between good and evil, and disobeying God is evil—their sinfulness is exposed to view. They feel embarrassment, a sense that they need to hide from God what they have done. This shame over what is revealed inside us quickly transfers to shame about what is visible on the outside. This shame involves not only hiding from God, but hiding from one another. Their relationship is no longer fully open.11. The group should be a safe place for sharing ideas, and group members will bene t from learning what other people think. Some people will struggle with this; they won’t see punishment as loving. But love, justice, and God’s nature/character are his motives for the consequences of sin. Verse 22 reveals his motive: If they eat from the tree of life in the state they are in (guilty of sin and separated from relationship with God, spiritually dead), they will live in that state forever. God has a plan to bring them back into relationship with him, and he needs to protect them so the plan can be accomplished.12. Be open to di erent ideas about how the judgments are manifested in society today. Some answers might be: We have to toil (not just work) to meet our needs and to survive; farming takes great e ort; women expe-121]]></text>

The  rst part of the promise in 3:15 is that there will be a struggle between Eve’s descendants and Satan (played out in the history of humankind, and especially between Satan and one of Eve’s descendants). The second part of the promise is that one of Eve’s o spring will crush the serpent’s head—he will have victory over Satan. The rest of this study will provide more detail later, so help the group look forward to learning the answer if it isn’t clear at this time.14. God protects Adam and Eve from eating from the tree of life, which would cause them to live forever separated from God in their fallen state.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping their abilities for service to God.16. The intent of this question is to encourage group members to set aside some time to spend with God in prayer and his Word at home each day throughout the week. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a good Bible reading plan and commitment, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes a life. The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the session or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each week after the Surrendering section. Encourage the group to see the importance of making time to connect with God a priority in their life. Encourage everyone to commit to a next step in prayer, Bible reading, or meditation on the Word.SharingJesus wants all of his disciples to help outsiders connect with him, to know him personally. This section should provide an opportunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.17. Encourage the group to observe their interactions during the coming week with the intention of using these observations next week in evaluating the people that God has placed in their lives that he might want them to share with or invite to small group.122]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s NotesSurrenderingGod is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will provide group members a chance to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship. Group prayer requests and prayer time should be included every week.18. Encourage group members to use the Re ections verses in their daily quiet time throughout the week. This will move them closer to God while rein- forcing the lesson of this session through related Scripture.Session Two The Promise DemonstratedConnecting2. We encourage groups to rotate hosts/leaders and homes each meeting. This practice will go a long way toward bonding the group. Review the Small Group Calendar and talk about who else is willing to open their home or facilitate a meeting. Refer hosts to the Leader’s Notes, Leading for the First Time (Leadership 101), and the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) in the Appendix for help preparing for their turn at facilitating the group meeting.Rotating host homes and leadership, along with implementing Team Roles as discussed in Session One will quickly move the group ownership from “your group” to “our group.”GrowingIf you are leading the group for the  rst time, refer to Leading for the First Time (Leadership 101) in the Appendix for help. Also, read through the Introduction in the Leader’s Notes and the Leader’s Notes for this ses- sion so you are prepared to lead the meeting. Don’t forget to encourage people as they participate in the discussion and don’t allow one person to dominate the discussion. Watch the time carefully and remember, it is not necessary that everyone answer every question in the Bible study.4. Moving hundreds of miles was much more di cult then than now. Abram would cut himself o  from the kinship network that was a person’s source of identity and safety. His kin would protect him; strangers would treat him as an outsider. He was leaving familiar customs behind. Moving to a foreign country can be wrenching today, but then it was far more of a culture shock.5. Like Adam, Abraham knows the command but doesn’t have lots of infor- mation about God’s reason for the command. God doesn’t explain, he asks for trust. There’s plenty of room for the tempter to raise doubts. But unlike123]]></text>
