<noscript> Leader’s NotesSurrenderingGod is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will provide group members a chance to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship. Group prayer requests and prayer time should be included every week.18. Encourage group members to use the Re ections verses in their daily quiet time throughout the week. This will move them closer to God while rein- forcing the lesson of this session through related Scripture.Session Two The Promise DemonstratedConnecting2. We encourage groups to rotate hosts/leaders and homes each meeting. This practice will go a long way toward bonding the group. Review the Small Group Calendar and talk about who else is willing to open their home or facilitate a meeting. Refer hosts to the Leader’s Notes, Leading for the First Time (Leadership 101), and the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) in the Appendix for help preparing for their turn at facilitating the group meeting.Rotating host homes and leadership, along with implementing Team Roles as discussed in Session One will quickly move the group ownership from “your group” to “our group.”GrowingIf you are leading the group for the  rst time, refer to Leading for the First Time (Leadership 101) in the Appendix for help. Also, read through the Introduction in the Leader’s Notes and the Leader’s Notes for this ses- sion so you are prepared to lead the meeting. Don’t forget to encourage people as they participate in the discussion and don’t allow one person to dominate the discussion. Watch the time carefully and remember, it is not necessary that everyone answer every question in the Bible study.4. Moving hundreds of miles was much more di cult then than now. Abram would cut himself o  from the kinship network that was a person’s source of identity and safety. His kin would protect him; strangers would treat him as an outsider. He was leaving familiar customs behind. Moving to a foreign country can be wrenching today, but then it was far more of a culture shock.5. Like Adam, Abraham knows the command but doesn’t have lots of infor- mation about God’s reason for the command. God doesn’t explain, he asks for trust. There’s plenty of room for the tempter to raise doubts. But unlike123 </noscript>
