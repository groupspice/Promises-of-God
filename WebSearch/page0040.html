<noscript> Leader’s Notesto obey or not; God expects obedience but also gives humans freedom of choice and the ability to think for ourselves; God gives commands and warns of the consequences of failing to obey, which show his love and concern; God cares about beauty, because his creation is beautiful; God cares about Adam’s need for companionship.6. Some things about Satan might include: Satan is deceptive; Satan misquotes and twists God’s words; Satan causes Eve to doubt God’s goodness; Satan takes a good motive of aspiring to be more like God and turns it toward disobedience.7. At the heart of Satan’s deception is questioning the reliability and goodness of God’s word. Humanity’s nature is to question God’s faithfulness, espe- cially when circumstances don’t seem to make sense. If Satan can convince us to doubt God, then he has been successful in alienating us from him, inviting evil into our lives. Satan also tempts Adam and Eve to be like God, to take charge of their destinies apart from God.8. We tend to run from situations and people, and even God, when we have done wrong. Even though we may know we have sinned, we fail to face it straight on. It’s humiliating and frightening to face the truth about ourselves.9. Even though we sin, God does not abandon us. He consistently loves us and provides for us, even when we don’t live up to His standard for us.10. This moment is the birth of shame, which is an emotion of feeling exposed as  awed or inadequate. They know the di erence between good and evil, and disobeying God is evil—their sinfulness is exposed to view. They feel embarrassment, a sense that they need to hide from God what they have done. This shame over what is revealed inside us quickly transfers to shame about what is visible on the outside. This shame involves not only hiding from God, but hiding from one another. Their relationship is no longer fully open.11. The group should be a safe place for sharing ideas, and group members will bene t from learning what other people think. Some people will struggle with this; they won’t see punishment as loving. But love, justice, and God’s nature/character are his motives for the consequences of sin. Verse 22 reveals his motive: If they eat from the tree of life in the state they are in (guilty of sin and separated from relationship with God, spiritually dead), they will live in that state forever. God has a plan to bring them back into relationship with him, and he needs to protect them so the plan can be accomplished.12. Be open to di erent ideas about how the judgments are manifested in society today. Some answers might be: We have to toil (not just work) to meet our needs and to survive; farming takes great e ort; women expe-121 </noscript>
